# OdysseyClassic
The game code for the cult hit running from the late 90's all the way up to 2010

This is the source code for the Odyssey Online Classic game that ran from the late 90's all the way through 2011.

This repository includes the main branch used through most of the 2000's, as well as the original 1999 code that my branch was based on.

I have also included the updater and update tools which have never been released before.  There is also a minimapper tool that if you give a starting point will map the overworld of your map from a bird's eye perspective.

Contact remote@codemallet.com if you have any questions or would like additional files to be uploaded here.

If there is any interest I may upload some server.dat files such as main, confrontations, etc. although I believe those are already out there.
