# The Odyssey Online Classic

This is the game code for the cult hit running from the late 90's all the way up to 2010

This is the source code for the Odyssey Online Classic game that ran from the late 90's all the way through 2011.

This repository includes my personal main branch used through most of the 2000's  I have also included the original 1999 code that my branch was based on with Bugaboo's permission.  We are both interested in people carrying the game on if they have the skills and there is still interest in the game.

I have also included the updater and update tools which have never been released before.  There is also a minimapper tool that if you give a starting point will map the overworld of your map from a bird's eye perspective.

If there is any interest I may upload some server.dat files such as main, confrontations, etc. although I believe those are already out there.
